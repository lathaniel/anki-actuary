  - Question: Merton Model
    Answer: |
      \(\frac{\ln(\frac{B}{X})-(r-.5\sigma^2)T}{\sigma\sqrt{t}}\)

  - Question: KMV Model
    Answer: |
      \(DD = \dfrac{X-\tilde B}{X\sigma}\)

  - Question: TE VAR
    Answer: |
      \(\alpha\sqrt{(x-x_0)^\top\mathbf{\Sigma}(x-x_0)}\)<br/><br/>where \((x-x_0)\) is a column vector

  - Question: Altman's Z-score
    Answer: |
      \(Z_n = 0.012X_{1,n} 
      + 0.014X_{2,n}
      + 0.033X_{3,n}
      + 0.006X_{4,n}
      + 0.999X_{5,n}\)
    Notes: |
      \(X_{1,n}\) = Ratio of working capital to total assets<br/>
      \(X_{2,n}\) = Ratio of retained earnings to total assets<br/>
      \(X_{3,n}\) = Ratio of EBIT to total assets<br/>
      \(X_{4,n}\) = Ratio of MV of equity to BV of liabilities<br/>
      \(X_{5,n}\) = Ratio of sales to total assets<br><br>

      Popular metric used in the manufacturing space. Closer to 3 => Solid; Closer to 0 => headed for bankruptcy

  - Question: How does the standard error of a MC estimate change?
    Answer: |
      With the number of simulations, k, it decreases at a rate of \(\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\)
    Section: VAR Ch. 12
    Notes: |
      Practical application: Can be used to determine the number of simulations needed to achieve
      a desired standard error (or reduction).

  - Question: Simulating stock price movement with GBM
    Answer: |
      \(dS_t = \mu_tS_td_t + \sigma_tS_tdz\)
    Section: VAR Ch. 12
    Notes: |
      Key concepts:
      <ul>
      <li>\(dz\) applies random shocks (via normal dist)</li>
      <li>GBM does not allow for sudden jumps</li>
      </ul>
  
  - Question: Mean-reverting stochastic differential equation
    Section: VAR Ch. 12
    Answer: \(dr_t = \kappa(\theta - r_t)dt + \sigma r_t^{\gamma}dz_t\)

  - Question: Pearson correlation coefficient
    Answer: \(\dfrac{Cov(X,Y)}{\sigma_x \sigma_y}\)
